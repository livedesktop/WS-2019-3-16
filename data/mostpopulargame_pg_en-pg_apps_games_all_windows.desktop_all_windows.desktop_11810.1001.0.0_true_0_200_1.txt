Not a lot, just a little bit, every day, hidden away in a vent. This was no easy feat in a totalitarian world where everything and every person was accounted for every minute of the day. A genius scientist, Number 221 was under orders to mass produce chemical missiles and viruses that would be strategically spread to deal with population control. He was under contract. Under orders. Under control. Number 221 was planning mutiny. But how do you destroy monsters without becoming one of them? There was no guarantee he'd survive. The medicine dissolved easily in the coffee, leaving no trace of evidence behind. He poured a cup for himself, and his guard. He sipped the poison, the antidote tucked safely in his lab coat. His guard did not have the same benefit. As his insides began to write in result, he waited for evidence the poison too was effecting his companion. As the man fell to the ground, Number 221 flipped the lid of the vial and tossed back the contents. The guard was a fool to trust a scientist, especially one willing to drink his own poison to ensure his success. Number 221 stepped over the body, drew a vial of the odious man's blood to pass security, and slipped from the lab he knew all too well. He wasn't anywhere close to being free. The safe house was a far way off and they would notice his absence soon. They would not risk losing him. He was too valuable. To survive, he was going to need to be careful. He was going to need to fight.\r\n\r\n\r\n★☆★☆Battle for Supremacy ★☆★☆\r\nAre you skilled enough, fast enough, powerful enough, and capable enough to eliminate all targets and complete the map in a designated time?

If you want to start off with a amazing power-up, you'll be offered the opportunity to watch a short video clip to earn it. You'll need to be quick.

A new, user-friendly interface boasts a new menu screen with map-style level select, but be aware, you'll need to unlock these levels by defeating the level before. Your enemies are stronger and more intelligent than ever, and with their higher health and damage, the fight you face will be no easy task. Fight hand-to-hand or wield an epic selection of melee and firearm weapons and take aim. Precision aiming will help you target your enemy and gain the advantage. Be ruthless in your approach.

Download today and experience for yourself one of the best first person shooter games available on the market! \r\n\r\n\r\n✲✲✲GAME STORY✲✲✲\r\nWe are an advanced civilization. One that has survived, and even thrived from the apocalypse. We are a world with many technical and otherworldly advances that boast the ability to open portals to other dimensions. This was done in order to study the effects of different consequences and alternate reality. It seemed to be safe enough, with all the safety precautions that were taken, but then the unthinkable happened. \r\n\r\nAfter the sustainment system failed during a massive power outage, the safety shield that kept the portal from being accessed by either side was lowered, and the vacuum ripped several agents from their stations, trapping them in these alternate dimensions...\r\n\r\nAs one of these agents sucked inside the portal, you are now trapped in a dimension where the world is drastically different, and all because of a choice made by a handful of men several millennia ago. This world is a treacherous place filled with dangers at every turn. You must remain alive in this bleak world until help can reach you... IF help can reach you.\r\n\r\n✲✲✲GAME PLAY✲✲✲\r\nThe game comes fully loaded with amazing features! Our new game interface is extremely user friendly, and boasts easy to play touch screen controls that allow you to effortlessly run, jump, sprint, reload, aim, shoot and more! \r\n\r\nThe new menu screen includes map style level select and settings screen. Gain game insight in between maps during loading with tip screens, and begin each game with mission style instructions! Before you begin your first level, you can watch a short video ad in order to earn a power up. You may opt not to watch, but you'll lose out on the advantage. \r\n\r\nAs soon as the game begins, a timer will begin to count down. If you are able to beat the level quickly enough, you will earn a permanent weapon, which can be used in all other levels! If you do not beat the clock, you can still advance through the game, just without the permanent weapon. \r\n\r\nFight stronger, more intelligent enemies, who make this game an intense battle of wit, stealth and skill! Enjoy hand-to-hand combat and precision aiming to take down enemies. Collect your blocky weapons and get ready to aim and shoot!!\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n-User friendly interface with touch pad controls\r\n-Timers\r\n-Power-ups\r\n-Ammo and weapon collection\r\n-Jump, aim and run\r\n-Mini-map to spot your dangerous foes\r\n-Mission orders\r\n-Hand-to-hand combat","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9P16WN1386D8","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Car Wash Game","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.2865.14516916750449343.32f16875-063c-40cf-a74d-b9b18dcaba21.e66cfab7-af9f-431e-b7c6-4881770e2355","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.58213.14516916750449343.32f16875-063c-40cf-a74d-b9b18dcaba21.c87d1c26-f98f-46ba-9bfd-7621ff02874a","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["5625MobileGamesStudio.CarWashGame_4va3atqj0fc0m"],"ContentIds":["504b9f9f-a901-2dfa-e985-f6ac25da0aeb"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Car Wash Salon Game is finally open for business - hang on to your seats because we're starting an amazing car wash adventure!

This game is quite addictive, that's for sure because it is very popular. If you loved Peggle Montezuma, marble woka woka Zuma Deluxe or Zumas Temple Quest. It's about our version of the famous Zuma. For the once that are wondering what kind of game is Zuma, here is little explanation. You will see many colorful balls in the game and the scope of the game is actually very simple - you must join 3 balls with same color on the chain and destroy them. So it sounds very easy and yes, it is but not that easy because it asks for some strategic thinking in order to complete this task.\r\n\r\nAlso you get a chance to choose your playing mode. When you are still a beginner, choose the 'easy mode' but as you become more skilled, the 'hard mode' would be your bigger challenge.\r\n\r\nThe game consists of three levels, three different worlds that hide their own challenges. The first world is 'Amazon jungle', the second one is 'Ancient Ruins' while the third one takes you to the \"Frozen Land\". You start joining the balls and if you don't manage to pass the level, you get a chance to play the level once again. Actually if you are not satisfied by our score in general, you could play again each level you want. Now let's see how is this going in praxis.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9P4D41K02WB8","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Spacelords","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.58996.14595459995378775.0a68b36a-c7ac-456a-9404-7595d73a6b16.56e063dc-a21f-4b74-92ec-bf937af7693c","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.23587.14595459995378775.0a68b36a-c7ac-456a-9404-7595d73a6b16.651866bf-07e1-40d5-8be5-4b3dfb393d9c","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.26994.14595459995378775.0a68b36a-c7ac-456a-9404-7595d73a6b16.8cbbfe9a-b6ea-41e0-bf10-f564bef4de16","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"BoxArt","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.35293.14595459995378775.0a68b36a-c7ac-456a-9404-7595d73a6b16.0944413d-a17c-4451-a914-8717c73a986e","Height":2160,"Width":2160,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.6523.14595459995378775.0a68b36a-c7ac-456a-9404-7595d73a6b16.1b01d0d9-8e6a-4b7d-a519-96fad44ce425","Height":2160,"Width":1440,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["MercurySteam.430775C070DC6_zp5sr8m1yfbvp"],"ContentIds":["c1973ee6-2757-d1ad-4e33-465c19df6f8d","b9e383b2-501b-6967-f93f-00d58e2dd45d","6fc80489-0927-4bb7-8c55-4cbeb6a2c948"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Xbox One","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Embark on an epic sci-fi, free-to-play adventure.

Build, expand, plan your strategy, the decision is in your hands!\r\nBut don’t stop there, recruit dozens of funny characters, add them to your collection and watch as they populate the streets and bring your city to life!\r\n\r\nBuild the BEST. CITY. EVER.\r\n- Craft hundreds of unique, gorgeous buildings in your city and expand it from a tiny, peaceful town to a big, bustling metropolis.\r\n- Don’t forget to decorate your skyline by building famous landmarks like the Eiffel Tower, the Tower of London or the Tower of Pisa (there’s something for every tower fan) to elevate your city to the top tourist destinations.\r\n\r\nMeet your new family \r\n- Cartoon fans rejoice! Meet and collect tons of funny characters with their own unique personalities, like the portly Sergeant Cakemore, or the uber-macho builder guy, Forest Manly (whose real skill is the tiny bit too suggestive eyebrow raise).\r\n- Build a water tower. Check! Build a fire station. Check! But who’s going to drive the fire truck? Assigning citizens to jobs will help you optimize your city, but you can go even further! Send them on missions and they won’t come home empty handed or do favors for them so they would invite their friends too to fill your city!\r\n\r\nFusion is the way to go\r\n- The future: age of smart forks, exploding hover boards, even selfies! But now the 21st century lives up to its promise, with the ability to merge buildings into advanced skyscrapers and unlock specializations.\r\n- Unlocking each allows you to develop your city towards different directions and expand your collection with specialized buildings such as Sustainability, Commerce, Education and Entertainment. Choose which one suits your strategy best!\r\n\r\nThe grass is always greener…\r\n- But is it really? Find out by visiting the cities of your friends. Is your friend the best builder you know? Well, you can always “borrow” a bit of their ideas to improve your game … sshhh, we won’t tell anyone…\r\n- In case you find yourself short on some crucial resources, visiting the Trade HQ should be a major part of your strategy, it is where you can collect some extra cash or find missing upgrade items.\r\n\r\n\r\n**** Game not optimized for Nokia 2520.\r\n\r\n_____________________________________________\r\n\r\nVisit our official site at http://gmlft.co/website_EN\r\nCheck out the new blog at http://gmlft.co/central\r\n\r\nDon't forget to follow us on social media:\r\nFacebook: http://gmlft.co/SNS_FB_EN\r\nTwitter: http://gmlft.co/SNS_TW_EN\r\nInstagram: http://gmlft.co/GL_SNS_IG\r\nYouTube: http://gmlft.co/GL_SNS_YT\r\n\r\nThis app allows you to purchase virtual items within the app and may contain third party advertisements that may redirect you to a third party site.\r\n\r\nPrivacy Policy: http://www.gameloft.com/en/privacy-notice\r\nTerms of Use: http://www.gameloft.com/en/conditions-of-use\r\nEnd-User License Agreement: http://www.gameloft.com/en/eula","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH5WKLW","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Pop Stars#","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.28922.13510798886376948.dbef68cf-c158-48bb-bfc2-c924e17877d3.16909b57-624a-48b1-a89a-5339e9993590","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#ff0000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"USD$1.99","Price":1.99,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["45773TouchGamesStudio.PopStars_wxwgnc9s6s58p"],"ContentIds":["9fe1c631-2554-f702-4c63-a51bb0e0163c"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Windows version of pop star game.\r\n\r\nHow To Play:\r\n- Tap two or more blocks of the same color.\r\n- The more blocks you pop, the more score you will get.\r\n- Try to clear all block","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NG9T2HQ0HRN","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Helix Jumper","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.5335.13648881748276069.156f47ee-ea80-4632-892f-247c35e711bf.48e4fb39-11dc-484f-852a-59f8988e5e0c","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"white","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.47126.13648881748276069.156f47ee-ea80-4632-892f-247c35e711bf.dc390e69-65e9-481d-b5b6-e6b42087c93f","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"white","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["25105CheetahIOGames.HelixJumper_g1xqr098r0t62"],"ContentIds":["177b2cf8-4995-a4f1-84b0-8c8fa280cf80","043c8d3f-8a3c-97b1-0a62-20a9f53a9735"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Exciting adventure of the bouncing ball through the helix tower labyrinth - Helix Jump !\r\n\r\nOne-tap easy-to-learn controls, rich visual effects and addictive gameplay mechanics.
