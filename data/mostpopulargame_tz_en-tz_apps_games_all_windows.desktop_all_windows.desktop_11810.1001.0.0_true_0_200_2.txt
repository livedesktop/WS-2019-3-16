Compete against players from around the world in a high speed online race.\r\n\r\nFUN DRIVING \r\nTraffic Race 3D 2 is a mixture of arcade racing and casual driving on open tracks. No more re-spawns when you hit the race track border. Go crazy and find the fastest route on each track. \r\n\r\nENDLESS RUNNER GAME MODE \r\nWe’ve invented a combination of endless running mode with a checkpoint system. You will not die because you crash, your car will take damage but just keep on going for as far as you can! \r\n\r\nGLOBAL HIGH SCORE\r\nAre you the best driver in the world? Now you can prove it! Show the world that you are the next Schumacher or Hamilton. Can you make it to 1st place in the global rank? We reset ranks every week on Mondays to keep the competition alive.  \r\n\r\nARCADE RACING PHYSICS\r\nWe’ve taken inspiration from all extreme motor sports: Nascar, F1, Le mans, Rally and then we’ve stripped it down to a casual driving experience. This lets you drift around corners at 240 km/h with your car while still having fun and do crash as often as you wish. \r\n\r\nSUITABLE FOR ALL AGES (PEGI 3)\r\nEveryone can enjoy Traffic Race 3D 2. You will actually probably become a better real driver regardless if you are an adult, teenager or child. \r\n\r\nINTUITIVE CONTROLS\r\nThe goal of this game is to make it easy and fast to run on any device (Mobile, PC, Tablet). \r\n\r\nCAMERA OF YOUR CHOICE\r\nWe’ve added the opportunity for you to switch camera mode between Chase, Helicopter or cockpit view so you really feel that you are driving a real car.  \r\n\r\nARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE – AI DRIVERS\r\nOur game includes AI drivers but our drivers are not perfect. They make mistakes and will not always stay on the track, probably just like you :o)\r\n\r\n100% FREE – WE PROMISE\r\nYou can unlock all cars and courses for free. You do not need to buy any smurf coins to play this game. Each time you race you gain coins to unlock cars. Courses can only be unlocked by achieving the best times on each track.  We do offer one IAP and we call it “All Inclusive”, it gives you all cars and eliminates all ads. \r\n\r\nFEEDBACK\r\nWe are listening to feedback from our users.

It is fundamentally different from most solitaire games in that very few hands are unsolvable. Although software implementations vary, most versions label the hands with a number (derived from the random number seed used to generate the hand).\r\n\r\nA version of FreeCell was created by Microsoft for release with the Windows operating system.\r\n\r\nFreeCell solitaire is one kinds of funny solitaire card game, but it's not like other solitaires. You need no luck to win, only skill is required. All cards are opened from the start and the deal has the solution, you can win, think and move wisely. \r\n\r\nKey Features: \r\n- deals with different difficulty \r\n- every completed deal has score \r\n- customizable background and card \r\n- magnetic card movement \r\n- supermove: multiple card dragging \r\n- drag or tap to move \r\n- undo option \r\n- optimized battery usage for very long gameplay \r\n\r\nRules\r\nConstruction and layout\r\nOne standard 52-card deck is used.\r\nThere are four open cells and four open foundations. Some alternate rules use between one to ten cells.\r\nCards are dealt into eight cascades, four of which comprise seven cards and four of which comprise six. Some alternate rules will use between four to ten cascades.\r\n\r\nBuilding during play\r\nThe top card of each cascade begins a tableau.\r\nTableaux must be built down by alternating colors.\r\nFoundations are built up by suit.\r\n\r\nMoves\r\nAny cell card or top card of any cascade may be moved to build on a tableau, or moved to an empty cell, an empty cascade, or its foundation.\r\nComplete or partial tableaus may be moved to build on existing tableaus, or moved to empty cascades, by recursively placing and removing cards through intermediate locations. Computer implementations often show this motion, but players using physical decks typically move the tableau at once.\r\n\r\nVictory\r\nThe game is won after all cards are moved to their foundation piles.\r\nVarious computer versions of Freecell occasionally deal unsolvable games.\r\n\r\n\r\nHistory\r\nOne of the oldest ancestors of FreeCell is Eight Off. In the June 1968 edition of Scientific American, Martin Gardner described in his \"Mathematical Games\" column a game by C. L. Baker that is similar to FreeCell, except that cards on the tableau are built by suit rather than by alternate colors. Gardner wrote, \"The game was taught to Baker by his father, who in turn learned it from an Englishman during the 1920s.\" This variant is now called Baker's Game. FreeCell's origins may date back even further to 1945 and a Scandinavian game called Napoleon in St. Helena (not the game Napoleon at St. Helena, also known as Forty Thieves).\r\n\r\nPaul Alfille changed Baker's Game by making cards build according to alternate colors, thus creating FreeCell. He implemented the first computerised version of it in the TUTOR programming language for the PLATO educational computer system in 1978. Alfille was able to display easily recognizable graphical images of playing cards on the 512 * 512 monochrome display on the PLATO systems.\r\n\r\nThis original FreeCell environment allowed games with 4–10 columns and 1–10 cells in addition to the standard 8 * 4 game. For each variant, the program stored a ranked list of the players with the longest winning streaks. There was also a tournament system that allowed people to compete to win difficult hand-picked deals. Paul Alfille describes this early FreeCell environment in more detail in an interview from 2000.\r\n\r\n\r\nSolver complexity\r\nThe FreeCell game has a constant number of cards. This implies that in constant time, a person or computer could list all of the possible moves from a given start configuration and discover a winning set of moves or, assuming the game cannot be solved, the lack thereof. To perform an interesting complexity analysis one must construct a generalized version of the FreeCell game with 4 * n cards. This generalized version of the game is NP-complete; it is unlikely that any algorithm more efficient than a brute-force search exists that can find solutions for arbitrary generalized FreeCell configurations.\r\n\r\nThere are 52! (i.e., 52 factorial), or approximately 8*1067, distinct deals. However, some games are effectively identical to others because suits assigned to cards are arbitrary or columns can be swapped. After taking these factors into account, there are approximately 1.75*1064 distinct games.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRFJ3WG","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Checkers Deluxe","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.7002.9007199266246291.b710ffe4-5c9f-4b9e-84b8-712913367a9a.0bd2a534-97cb-4701-823d-c1c4bf979597","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#CA8E5D","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.9658.9007199266246291.0a61c213-7f40-4e66-8e03-3b1ea429f1ab.d38f0fe3-b0f9-4c6e-ad03-5d6a1f5a85fc","Height":225,"Width":225,"BackgroundColor":"#CA8E5D","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.64884.9007199266246291.da91a4c5-da3a-4817-8034-267598c285c3.bb7dc438-30c6-4b8d-8f81-76e2b9ea4a8c","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#CA8E5D","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.21289.9007199266246291.4bab2ed1-6944-445f-af97-79e012f282fd.d95101eb-82ca-4207-8c99-63b11a21998c","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#CA8E5D","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.5695.9007199266246291.6181d511-4924-4f78-91e7-edcb6d4a48b8.c88272f8-4a35-4bac-add2-488c7aa15fe6","Height":465,"Width":465,"BackgroundColor":"#CA8E5D","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.17240.9007199266246291.406f531a-3f48-4f95-bd73-5e76fdc03fce.bbd46c58-accd-4a2d-9a36-fc59e65e62a8","Height":620,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#CA8E5D","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.38133.9007199266246291.2f4dfb0b-d754-4c19-90a8-2aa1b01213cf.3d55b23a-7ae7-4bb0-aec1-3690a826cc1f","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#CA8E5D","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.26903.9007199266246291.f782c4a4-626f-4465-93d0-d3249d6806d1.d2ef23f0-d6f5-4ee9-b785-e83045512078","Height":225,"Width":465,"BackgroundColor":"#CA8E5D","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.48763.9007199266246291.0f045e42-bb6f-4aea-9239-2aa6b5b734f2.e8e23d3d-cf85-4eea-805f-363a5eb26f1b","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#CA8E5D","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.27340.9007199266246291.e4691965-9a68-4685-b80c-9984d63921d1.69e89da1-ba0f-4f41-9da5-429f916bdb50","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#CA8E5D","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["26720RandomSaladGamesLLC.CheckersDeluxe_kx24dqmazqk8j"],"ContentIds":["bcbced21-3b71-5c75-130e-57b80fdcee20","50462a4f-1d3e-263c-33ff-6101a7993305"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"  ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,HoloLens,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Enjoy the #1 Checkers game for Windows!\r\n\r\nPlay Checkers Deluxe, a fun and free version of the classic game of Checkers.

Starting with Windows 98 other version of solitaire joined the suit - FreeCell, Spider, Tri-Peaks and Pyramid. As a part of the standard Windows installation those games have been popularized around the world. For each of those games millions of clones have been created on all possible platforms. So why should you give our version a try? We combined all six games (Klondike, Spider, FreeCell, Tri-Peaks and two flavors of Pyramid) in a tiny download package. \r\n\r\nThe fun of original games is preserved but some improvement are made to make it easier to play on the small factor devices. In particular, you don't have to drag individual cards - drag&drop whole column, only proper cards will move the rest will snap back. The scoring all the games is simplified to track only number of moves to solve the puzzle. If you stuck, feel free to use hints or undo - implemented by all the games.

Carrom is a similar to Billiards or Table Shuffleboard game however instead of pool cues you use your fingers.\r\n\r\nThe object of the game is to flick a striker to hit and pocket a playing coin. The coins can be pocketed into any pocket.\r\n\r\nAs there are a huge number of variations in the rules exists so this App 'tries' to support 2 types of popular Carrom game play i.e. 'Family-Point' and 'Professional' and implements only those Carrom rules which I found practical to implement.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n1. App does not allowed to strike backward from carrom-stricker baseline.\r\n2. Due to scoring rules in 'Professional' game play mode, scoring can only be possible after current round is over.\r\n3. Player sides does not change during the game rather first player breaks first for odd (e.g. 1, 3 ...) number rounds and second player breaks first in even (e.g. 2, 4 ...) number rounds.\r\n4. Max number of rounds for 'Family-Point' game is 5 while 'Professional' mode game is 8. Player can always 'Give up' game during rounds play then game will declares game winner!\r\n5. App provides user to save up to maximum of 9 game plays. \r\n\r\nNote: I have recently released online version of this game app name 'Carrom online', if you are interested to play online please do try that app.\r\n\r\nKindly rate this app that would encourage me to come with new updates and improvements in future.

One of the Microsoft developers noticed this version and implemented a version for Windows. It was first included with Win32s as an application that enabled the testing of the 32-bit thunking layer (does anyone remember what that was?). FreeCell remained relatively obscure until it was released as part of Windows 95. \r\nSince then the game has been ported to numerous platforms. So why should you give our version a try? We largely tried to recreate a full experience of the game in a tiny download package, including power moves, hints and undo (top right corner of the title bar). But there are also some minor twists to make it easier to play on a small factor mobile devices. In particular you don't have to select a card to move - drag and drop entire column - only appropriate cards will move, the rest will snap back. The cards will be moved to foundation automatically when possible. The scoring is also changed - only number of moves counted - the lower the score - the better. \r\n\r\nOnly the top (exposed) card of each tableau pile is available for play. It may be moved to a foundation pile, a free cell, or to another tableau pile. Within the tableau, cards are built down in sequence and alternating in color. Any card may be moved into an empty space. Blocks of cards may not be moved, unless the requisite number of free cells and/or tableau spaces are available to allow each individual card to be moved. To move part of partial pile, drag whole pile - the game will self adjust. If you fill all four foundation piles, you win. \r\nIf you don't see any more moves try hints, undo (top right corner) to back track, or menu to start new game.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDJ9XS","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Word Search -

A scoreboard is maintained which kid can see after each game. When kid scores enough points, he/she earns a sticker of his/her choice. All his/her earned stickers are kept in a box which he/she can relish any time they want later.\r\n\r\nWe have put our every effort to make this app interesting and beautiful.

The 2019 edition of Bridge features faster and stronger game play with smoother user interface.\r\n\r\nBridge is a card game played by four players who form two partnerships. Players within a partnership face each other across the bridge table. Traditionally, the players are referred to by the points of the compass - North, East, South and West. The two partnerships are North/South and East/West. Games are played to the best of three.  During bidding, each partnership exchanges information to decide a contract. Once established the cards are played with the declarer attempting to fulfill the contract + the opponents attempting to defeat it.\r\n\r\nBridge includes the all new state of the art advanced Bridge card play engine playing at a significantly stronger level. By analysing the probable permutations of the remaining cards Bridge will frequently find an extra trick to make or defeat a contract. \r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE:\r\nThis game is ad-funded.

Smash as many bowling pins as you want!\r\n- 110 fun and challenging levels! \r\n- Addictive! Can you get a strike on each level?\r\n- Puzzles of varying difficulty (easy, medium, hard and INSANE)\r\n- Simple gameplay! Easy to learn, hard to master!

The deep snow in the winters has made it difficult for people to move around and tourists are also planning skiing trips and you have to transport the passengers and ski gear to offroad deep snow mountain tracks. Drive the snow tourist bus and pick n drop the passengers. You also have to pick the tourists from snowy hill resorts to city. Deep snow has made it very difficult & dangerous to drive on the narrow roads of the city and off road tracks have become even more risky. Make sure you don't hit the traffic and people on the road as it is really cold due to snow blizzards and the roads have become narrower. Snowy Bus Drive is a challenging game testing driving skills in risky and dangerous conditions and difficult paths. Hill drivers are really experts in cutting those hilly corners and curves but snow adds to the risk and challenge. Tourists in the mountain top resorts are depending for their survival on you so that they can reach the city safe and sound. Be the best snow bus driver on city and off-road conditions.\r\n\r\nUse the controls to accelerate and brake according to the conditions. Drive carefully and make sure you can see your way in the snow and control the bus on the skiddy ice. It is like a thin sheet of glass on the roads. Everything is covered in snow from the hill tops & mountain to roads to houses to hotels. The met department has reported that the snow storm is likely to keep at this pace for many days to come and people cannot use their cars to travel in this weather. Since you are one of the only few bus drivers providing the transport services in these tough hilly conditions on off-road and city roads, you have to be fast and rush to your destination to pick as many passengers as possible. People are depending upon you to reach their homes for Christmas and New Year. You are an expert snow driver who can make all this happen.\r\n\r\nYou have multiple game play missions in hilly off road conditions to complete so be ready for the kicks and excitement. Just launch into the game and drive away and you have to make sure you are driving safe. You will experience both city and off-road environment and view many scenic views of mountains and hills while you are driving in the snowy conditions. Drive the extreme snow bus drive away!\r\n\r\nWe hope you enjoy the game.

How long can you survive the arena? Smell the petrol fumes and enjoy the destruction!\r\n\r\nSome of the awesome features of this game:\r\n- Many tracks and race events\r\n- Intense destruction and racing action\r\n- Realistic car damage\r\n- Choose between various all American muscle cars\r\n- Customize and improve your car by earning or buying upgrades\r\n- Choose and modify your car control system to your own preference\r\n- Next to pure demolition events you can race on ovals and dirt tracks\r\n- Smooth 3D graphics and sound effects\r\n\r\nGet ready to race and destroy your opponents in demolition derbies and track races (mini ovals and dirt tracks included) that will offer you the thrill of a lifetime. Destruction has never felt so real as you see doors and other car parts smash of your car. \r\n\r\nSome game-play tips:\r\nHave fun smashing and destroying your adversaries, but understand that the game is a quite accurate simulation of the real thing! In this derby simulator limiting car damage is key to becoming victorious and how you smash into other cars makes a big difference. Always try to smash rivals in the side of their vehicle or from the rear. Head-on collisions on the other hand should be avoided. Practice makes perfect!\r\n\r\nUpgrades:\r\nYou have various cars you can unlock. These all have the pros and cons. Be sure to upgrade your cars wisely as the various type of events require different cars. Use armor upgrades to strengthen your endurance; or engine upgrades to boost your speed. To get your upgrades you earn money during races. The better you perform the more you earn. Before a race you can also buy power-ups to boost your performance during a race. The nitro boost will allow you to accelerate super-fast and smash your opponents even harder; or choose one of the other power-ups such an armor booster to strengthen your car during the race. \r\n\r\nIf you like demolition games this game is made for you!\r\n3, 2, 1 start your download and join the ultimate demolition derby game experience now!","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH4X04F","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"¼ Learn Sight Read Music Notes -

Clear stages to unlock new balls.\r\n\r\nONE HUNDRED PINS\r\n\r\nKnock down as many pins as you can in 5 throws at a rack of 100 pins!\r\n\r\nCANDLEPIN BOWLING\r\n\r\nInvented in 1880. Candlepin bowling offers a great challenge. Candlepins are thin skittles that bounce and spin unpredictably when struck. Pins aren't cleared between rounds allowing you to knock them into still upright pins.\r\n\r\nFIVE PIN BOWLING\r\n\r\n Invented in 1904 in Canada. In 5 pin, each pin is worth different point values. Spares are strategic attempts to hit the most valuable pins. A perfect game is 450 points!\r\n\r\nNINE PIN (GERMAN BOWLING)\r\n\r\nInvented in medieval Germany, 9 pin is what most later bowling games are based on. Nine pins are arranged in a diamond shape with a \"kingpin\" in the middle. Knocking all the pins over earns 9 points. Knocking all the pins over but the kingpin earns 12!\r\n\r\nLONG ALLEY SKITTLES\r\n\r\nKnock over pins by throwing a barrel-shaped 'cheese'! To score points, you first have to knock over the kingpin. It's tricky to master when the ball bounces unpredictably!\r\n\r\nDUCK PIN\r\n\r\nInvented in 1904 in New England. Duck pin uses the nearly the same rules as 10 pin, but allows 3 rounds to knock over all the pins. The ball and pins are smaller making precision very important to score well!\r\n\r\nIRON PIN\r\n\r\nIron pin is the same as normal bowling but one random pin is much heavier than the others. Careful consideration has to be made on how to knock over the heavy pin while also clearing the normal ones.\r\n\r\nSHUFFLE BOWLING\r\n\r\nBowling on a shuffleboard table! Knock over the pins with a weighted puck.\r\n\r\nWEST COUNTY SKITTLES\r\n\r\nTraditional skittles game that has been played in British pubs for centuries.\r\n\r\nGalaxy Bowling has an option to purchase Candlepin, Duck Pin, Five Pin, Nine Pin, 100 pin, and Iron Pin variants.
